1. Refer to the link below the general guidance to build a classification model using 
Python to predict the species of iris flowers based on their sepal length, sepal 
width, petal length, and petal width.

Explore and utilize the machine learning model, and evaluate the model's 
performance using evaluation metrics insights into its accuracy and 
generalization capability. The dataset description can be found at -

2. Implement the Decision Tree algorithm (DecisionTreeClassifier) using Python 
on the given customer churn dataset to predict customer churn. Consider the 
dataset's features such as gender, age, dependents, tenure, phone service, 
number of lines, internet service, device protection, technical support, streaming, 
contract status, paperless billing, payment method, monthly charges, total 
charges, and churn information. Evaluate the accuracy of your model and discuss 
the potential insights gained from the decision tree's structure in understanding 
the factors influencing customer churn. The dataset description can be found at:

3. Using MLPClassifier (backpropagation), build a classification model for a mobile 
price classification dataset. Implement a neural network model to predict the price 
range of mobile phones based on given features. Evaluate the performance of 
the model and discuss the results, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
score. Additionally, explore and discuss any potential improvements or 
modifications that can be made to enhance the model's performance. The 
dataset description can be found at :
